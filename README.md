## Introduction
These programs will automatically find the solutions to any layout of  the game "Lazors" (available as an app on iOS and Android). This game utilizes several manipulatable blocks that can be placed decisively by the user around a grid to change the ligtt path of a lazer. The goal is to guide the lazer to specific target point(s) using a specific combinaiton of blocks. There are different types of blocks, a) reflect blocks, b) opaque blocks, and c) refract blocks, as well an unmovable blocks which will sereve as non-manipulatable obstacles.
